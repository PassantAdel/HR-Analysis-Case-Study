# HR-Analysis-Case-Study
This project is focused on building and evaluating several classification models to predict employee promotions. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
This is the HR datasets. In our dataset 50000 rows and 14 columns. Every year, around 5% of its employees have promoted in the company. so, we have the check employee is promoted or not?

# Installation
Ensure that you have the following packages installed:

* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

# How it Works
1. Data Collection: We collected a diverse dataset of vehicles, including different types, colors, damage statuses, speeds, and license plate variations.
2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure high-quality training data.
3. Training: We trained the YOLOv8 model using the preprocessed dataset.
4. Real-time Inference: The trained model is integrated into our system to perform real-time attribute recognition.
5. User Interface: The user interacts with the system through an easy-to-use interface, providing images or video feeds for analysis.
6. Display Results: The system displays the recognized attributes for each detected vehicle, providing valuable information to the user.

# Installation
