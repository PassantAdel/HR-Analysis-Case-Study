# HR-Analysis-Case-Study
This project is focused on building and evaluating several classification models to predict employee promotions. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
This is the HR datasets. In our dataset 50000 rows and 14 columns. Every year, around 5% of its employees have promoted in the company. so, we have the check employee is promoted or not?

# Data Description
The project utilizes the following datasets:
*train.csv - the training dataset
*test.csv - the testing dataset

# Installation
Ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

# Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values by imputing the most frequent values and mean values for specific columns.
* Converting categorical variables to numerical values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
* Analyzing the data distribution using histograms.
* Visualizing the count of promotions with respect to gender, department, and education.

# Models Implemented
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Results
The models were evaluated using training and testing accuracy metrics, and the classification reports were generated for each model. Below are the results obtained:

* Logistic Regression:
** Training Accuracy: 0.916
** Testing Accuracy: 0.914

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Training Accuracy: 0.926
Testing Accuracy: 0.915

* Decision Tree:
** Training Accuracy: 0.945
** Testing Accuracy: 0.903
  
* Support Vector Machine (SVM):
** Training Accuracy: 0.915
** Testing Accuracy: 0.914
